```

### Core Components

- **🧠 BankingChatbot**: Main orchestrator implementing the SRAL framework
- **🏦 MockBankingAPI**: Realistic banking service simulation
- **🎯 Intent Classifier**: Three-tier classification system
- **💾 Context Manager**: Maintains conversation state
- **📚 Learning System**: Stores interactions for improvement

## 📊 Intent Classification System

The chatbot categorizes all requests into three intelligent tiers:

| Tier | Category | Examples | Requirements |
|------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Basic Query** | Interest rates, charges, general info | None |
| 2 | **Account Query** | Balance, transactions, account details | Account number |
| 3 | **Specific Task** | Loan applications, card blocking | Account + additional info |

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Built With
- **Python 3.8+** - Core language
- **Google GenAI** - Natural language understanding
- **Mock APIs** - Banking service simulation
- **JSON** - Data serialization
- **Regex** - Entity extraction

### Key Classes

#### `BankingChatbot`
Main conversation handler implementing the SRAL framework.

```python
def chat(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    classification = self.sense(user_input)      # Understand intent
    reasoning = self.reason(classification)      # Plan actions
    response = self.action(reasoning)            # Execute tasks
    self.learn(user_input, response)            # Store interaction
    return response
```

#### `MockBankingAPI`
Comprehensive banking service simulation with realistic data and processing.

```python
# Sample account data
accounts = {
    "12345678": {
        "customer_name": "John Doe",
        "balance": 15000.50,
        "credit_score": 750
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Custom Mock Data
Modify `MockBankingAPI.__init__()` to add:
- More customer accounts
- Additional transaction history
- Custom interest rates
- Different credit scores

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
Use these commands during conversation:
